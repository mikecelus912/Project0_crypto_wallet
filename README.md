# Project0_crypto_wallet
My first python and MongoDB project

This project contains a menu system that is controlled utilizing a while loop.
There are functions that the user can use for basic CRUD operations.
A submenu is present for registered users who login using their username and password credentials.
The user can then update or delete their profile.
In addition, the user can also view current cryptocurrency information using a separate menu option.
I hope to eventually implement more functionality and security features over time.
